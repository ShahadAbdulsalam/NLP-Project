PM Trudeau himself blames Harper, because it was during Harper's tenure as PM that private sector pharmaceutical manufacturers left Canada. However, there is no evidence that any policy of the Harper government was responsible for that. It was the Mulroney government that privatized Connaught Laboratories, Canada's government-run pharmaceutical lab, in 1986. The Trudeau Liberals themselves are not blameless. Trudeau spent $44 million to co-develop a vaccine with China, but then China refused to allow shipment of the vaccine to Canada for trials. Trudeau announced another $120 million in August, saying it would enable the domestic production of vaccines starting in November. That failed too, for unknown reasons. The Trudeau government also failed to secure domestic production rights in any of its vaccine procurement contracts. NDP leader Singh just held a press conference blaming both Conservatives and Liberals for Canada's lack of vaccine production capacity, but the NDP escapes blame only because they have never been in government. Singh called for a Crown corporation like Connaught Labs to be re-established, but he also cited Australia as an example of a country similar to Canada that is producing its own COVID vaccines domestically, while failing to mention that vaccine production in Australia, as well as the US, UK, India, Belgium, and most other G20 countries, is being done entirely by the private sector. So the real question that has to be answered is why pharmaceutical companies don't find Canada an attractive place to set up shop.

Canadians were already suffering from unacceptable wait times of months or years for seeing a physician or a specialist or having serous surgery done or being treated for cancer - and now this Covid 19 vaccine related debacle.Current debacle to be devoid of capabilities to manufacture Covid 19 vaccine and then further failures to procure the vaccine developed and manufactured elsewhere is momentous failure on part of all levels of Governments - Federal, Provincial, Municipal- to look after heath and welfare of all Canadians.We can do it - I know when Canadians set their minds to any task they are capable of accompalishing it. I implore to politicians/appointed/annointed/hired dignitaries to not to let Canadians down and to please act intelligently and efficiently and compassionately to ensure health and welfare need of Canadians is looked after optimally.

Wear a mask when indoors - anywhere except your own household. Don't attend or host parties or attend gatherings.

The first two 90% and the third one around 60-70%. \"The length of immunity is short!\". Actually, nobody knows the length of immunity. It may be short it may be long.

Especially considering top Con MPs like Rempel and Poulivre playing with conspiracy theories, pumping out misinformation, and doing their best to politicize the pandemic response like when Rempel dismissed the evidence of a pandemic committee just because it's head, a scientist, had donated to the Libs in the past. Their job is to hold the govt to account not to dismiss evidence just because the messenger hasn't supported the Cons. That sort of politicization of the pandemic response kills people, it's why Covid is so out of control in the US.I was pleasantly surprised by the opposition parties early in the pandemic but am appalled by much of what I'm seeing, especially from the Cons but I've also been disappointed by the NDP who haven't seemed to understand the difference between federal and provincial responsibilities. The Trudeau Lib govt's pandemic response obviously hasn't been perfect, it's been the most unique situation all of Canada has been in since WW2 so I'm willing to cut them some slack, I don't expect to support everything any govt does. But I have no doubt the Trudeau Libs pandemic response has the best interests of all Canadians at heart. We've seen in Ontario and Alberta how con premiers have used it as cover to benefit their donors in some of the most blatant cases of cronyism I've ever seen in all my years paying attention to politics. Also it's no accident that the provinces worst hit by Covid are run by conservative govts. It makes me very grateful we have the Libs in office in Ottawa,\n",

Long-term complications are possible with the vaccine, but I'd suggest they're far more probable with COVID. So the math tells me, get the shot.,\n",

The period of unchecked multiplication is so short that we can't even recognize that it happened - hence we say it has \"prevented infection\".,\n",

However, given the positive data in trials to date, I'm comfortable that the benefits associated with it outweigh the risks (which I think are remote).

An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) overseeing the Phase 3 trial of the investigational COVID-19 vaccine known as mRNA-1273 reviewed trial data and shared its interim analysis with the trial oversight group on Nov. 15, 2020. This interim review of the data suggests that the vaccine is safe and effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in adults. The interim analysis comprised 95 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 among volunteers. The DSMB reported that the candidate was safe and well-tolerated and noted a vaccine efficacy rate of 94.5%. The findings are statistically significant, meaning they are likely not due to chance. 90 of the cases occurred in the placebo group and 5 occurred in the vaccinated group. There were 11 cases of severe COVID-19 out of the 95 total, all of which occurred in the placebo group.,\n",

       " Too many people are playing partisan games with the very serious question of why Canada cannot produce COVID vaccines. PM Trudeau himself blames Harper, because it was during Harper's tenure as PM that private sector pharmaceutical manufacturers left Canada. However, there is no evidence that any policy of the Harper government was responsible for that. It was the Mulroney government that privatized Connaught Laboratories, Canada's government-run pharmaceutical lab, in 1986. The Trudeau Liberals themselves are not blameless. Trudeau spent $44 million to co-develop a vaccine with China, but then China refused to allow shipment of the vaccine to Canada for trials. Trudeau announced another $120 million in August, saying it would enable the domestic production of vaccines starting in November. That failed too, for unknown reasons. The Trudeau government also failed to secure domestic production rights in any of its vaccine procurement contracts. NDP leader Singh just held a press conference blaming both Conservatives and Liberals for Canada's lack of vaccine production capacity, but the NDP escapes blame only because they have never been in government. Singh called for a Crown corporation like Connaught Labs to be re-established, but he also cited Australia as an example of a country similar to Canada that is producing its own COVID vaccines domestically, while failing to mention that vaccine production in Australia, as well as the US, UK, India, Belgium, and most other G20 countries, is being done entirely by the private sector. So the real question that has to be answered is why pharmaceutical companies don't find Canada an attractive place to set up shop. Let's stop the partisan nonsense and get to the bottom of it. ,\n",

       " In this COVID-19 pandemic, keeping Canadians safe means getting a vaccine as quickly as possible, but it also means making sure that the vaccine is safe for Canadians,\" Trudeau said '\" Yep, that's why Mr. Trudeau, Ms. Hajdu and the Cabinet should be the first recipients of the vaccine; then we will all follow suit.,\n",
       " The vaccine comes when it comes. The political game that's evolved is ridiculous but was inevitable. It's like crying out \"when is next year going to arrive?\". Partisan politics is a sad spectacle to witness and the general populace are tired of it, most people want to yell out \"Get Real!\".

       " opposition critics and some premiers accuse his government of falling behind on a vaccine distribution plan. O'Toole decided for himself to pursue the most pressing issues...delivery dates.Meanwhile the cohort of Con is withholding millions of federal money from doctors and nurses(Kenney) and topping up Con salaries with a $1.6 million dollar round table covid committee, sans scientific expertise, comprising of Con bureaucrats and MPPs (Ford).Does the name Dean French come to mind when you heard of this.,\n",

       " O'Toole is borrowing from the Trump playbook except that he's falling flat on his face. But the neck beards still believe anything he says.,\n",
       " Hmmmm. How would anyone compare Trump to any Canadian representative? Two totally different systems and in spite of Trump, theirs is way better simply it is by the people for the people that is what Trump actually likes about our system is the \"monarchy\"(he could just stay in the background). It would give him what he likes total power. Trump is gone and our monarchy keeps on going. This from a Canadian Conservative and yes I way prefer O'Toole over Trudeau any day. Cheers,\n",
       " I wish you all good health, but that doesn't come from a pill or a syring,\n",

       " They have to wait the green lights from regulators and Vaccine experts in addition to receiving a notice of immenent shipments my guess.,\n",
       " There's also this little tidbit having something to do with the manufacturer giving us a shipping date. Not sure the CPC method, schedule vaccine appointment for the 1st, company ships vaccine on the 8th, is all that efficient.,\n",
       " Wheres my pony, Justin promised me a pony.,\n",
       " After Health Canada approvals? Is that the same Health Canada that the Trudeau government is now responsible for?,\n",
       " Great I will remember that when the CRA keeps harassing me for payment...I told you I will make payment as quickly as possible.,\n",
       " Wonder why Trudeau mislead parliament today when he falsely claimed that the cancellation of the CanSino deal left Canada with contracts with 7 companies when in fact we only had contracts with 2 companies at the time?,\n",
       " His message is 2021 for me and 2022 for thee. Poor planning on his teams part means regular Canadians should suffer. Incompetence, as quickly as possible,\n",
       " I think there should be several discrete review groups to determine the roll out. It will and should be different in each province or territory. For example in Manitoba, Winnipeg has a large poor indigenous population and as poor people are more at risk the city should include poor and indigenous poor in the first 3 or 4 groups to get vaccine.In remote areas where there is no current high infection these can be better helped with an enhanced health control process to stop infections from taking hold.In areas that are infected and hard to get to, then vaccinate everyone not infected. In large cites in moderate climates like Vancouver or Victoria the homeless and poor should be hing on the priority lists.I do think though we should retain 10% of vaccines to sell to the ultra rich families, business execs and any others with buckets of money so they can skip the queue for 2-5,000's or more.\n",
       " The justification is that we can't completely segregate the groups for example is a mild 68 year old asthmatic to be included under the 'at risk' group, I do not think so.We can reduce the debt by allowing rich and influential people to buy the vaccine for them selves or their friends, just put a cap on the amount we allow for greed,\n",
       " incompetence, as quickly as possible. And when the vaccine is delayed even further, JT will say, \"I'm very very very very mad\",\n",
       " I'm sure he'll find a way to blame Stephen Harper.,\n",
       " The moment the vaccine is approved Trudeau will immediately be rolling out all 72 doses in Canada's first allotment!,\n",
       " Not 'funny'. Oh and I hope you are way, way down on the to get it list,\n",
       " You are correct Phillip the LIBERAL incompetence is not funny!,\n",
       " as quickly as possible, incompetence. Does anyone believe a single word Trudeau says any more? Anyone?,\n",
       " right. A liberal deadline promise. About as believable as their clean drinking water promises.,\n",
       " As quickly as possible means absolutely nothing.,\n",
       " China has played a major role in ripping off Canadians when it comes to vaccine technology. China has infiltrated the system, and then refuses to ship the vaccine, Chinese nationals have stolen intellectual property in exchange for big payouts from the CCP. This is a form of biological warfare. And it is a big sign that Trudeau is a weak leader. China has infiltrated every aspect of Canadian life. Something must be done about Chinese nationals in every important institution.,\n",
       " China's leaders know that Trudeau is a weak leader and by virtue of this Canada is seen as a weak country. It's shocking that so many Lib supporters don't seem to realize this.,\n",
